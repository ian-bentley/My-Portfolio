                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>This project was created for the practice of formatting and styling form elements with user 
                    experience and responsive design in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>Development</h2>
                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to design a form for a subscription to a fictitious newsletter. 
                    The page and form itself were made to be responsive using a mobile-first design. It makes use 
                    of required fields, radio buttons, and a dropdown menu for the state. The responsive layout makes
                use of media queries and flexboxes.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>One challenge related to this project was shifting the layout in response to larger screens. The 
                    form needed to only expand to a certain point and center itself beyond that. When it came to the 
                    form elements, a flexbox had to be used to align the labels to be in line with the inputs. 
                    Furthermore, the inputs had to be in line with each other despite their labels being variable in 
                    length.</p>
